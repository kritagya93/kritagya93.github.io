I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.mtsu.edu/csc/) at the [Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU)](https://www.mtsu.edu/) specializing in the area of **Blockchain and Smart Contracts, Artificial Intelligence, Data Cooperatives and Security, Fuzzy Logic, and Metaverse**. 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Science and Engineering under the mentorship of [Prof. Dr. Ram Dantu](https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/people/faculty/ram-dantu) from [University of North Texas](https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/). 

My research involves designing architectures, models, and algorithms with sound theoretical foundations and building prototype systems. Additionally, I am involved in few other projects: **Blockchain for Trusted Artificial Intelligence and Big Data**, **Vagueness Detection and Interpretation Ranking in Legal Contracts using ChatGPT**, **Data Cooperatives for Privacy and Security**, and **Applications for Secured Metaverse**. The principal motivation behind my research work is to develop efficient and enabling solutions for real-world issues in emerging and novel technologies concerning uncertainty, trust, privacy, and security.


I invite you to read my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bhEKUskAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and explore my [CV](https://kritagya93.github.io/files/CV_Kritagya_Upadhyay.pdf) to uncover the research problems and areas of interest that have been central to my academic and professional journey. This will provide you with valuable insights into my expertise and focus.
