Kritagya Raj Upadhyay is a PhD Candidate in [Department of Computer Science and Engineering](https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/) at the [University of North Texas](https://www.unt.edu/) specializing in the area of **Blockchain-based Smart Legal Contracts**, with an emphasis on the **ambiguity and vagueness resolution in the natural language**. His work involves designing architectures, models, and algorithms with sound theoretical foundations and building prototype systems. His current research is **inter-disciplinary** and is centered on the idea of converting the vague legal contracts to Blockchain-based Smart Legal Contracts. His current research focuses on the key enabling technologies such as **Fuzzy Logic**, **Natural Language Processing**, and **Artificial Intelligence** that can aid in the conversion of vague legal contracts to Blockchain-based Smart Legal Contracts.

Kritagya is a member of [Network Security Lab (NSL)](https://nsl.cse.unt.edu/content/kritagya-upadhyay-phd-student) at UNT. Additionally, he is involved in three other projects: **Blockchain for Trusted Artificial Intelligence**, **Data Cooperatives for Privacy and Security**, and **Multimodal Deep Learning for Secured Metaverse**. The principal motivation behind his research work is developing efficient and enabling solutions for real-world issues in emerging and novel technologies concerning ambiguity, vagueness, and trust. His work has produced new insights into these promising areas of research, resulting in several publications which are cited by peers.

Part of his role at UNT is being a **Teaching Assistant**, where he is responsible for teaching, assisting, and developing study materials for a diverse range of courses, including **Foundations of Computer Science and Programming**, **Foundations of Data Structures**, **Introduction to Computer Security**, **Introduction to Computer Networks**, **Computer Forensics**, **Advance Network Security**, **Blockchain Development and Applications**, **Applications of Cryptography**, and **Secure Software Systems**.
