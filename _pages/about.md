I am an Assistant Professor in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.mtsu.edu/csc/) at the [Middle Tennessee State University (MTSU)](https://www.mtsu.edu/) specializing in the area of **Blockchain and Smart Contracts, Artificial Intelligence, Data Cooperatives and Security, Fuzzy Logic, and Metaverse**. I am also affiliated with [Computational and Data Science](https://www.mtsu.edu/programs/computational-science-phd/faculty).

I obtained my Ph.D. in Computer Sciene and Engineering under the mentorship of [Prof. Dr. Ram Dantu](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~rdantu/) from [University of North Texas](https://computerscience.engineering.unt.edu/). 

My research involves designing architectures, models, and algorithms with sound theoretical foundations and building prototype systems. Additionally, I am involved in few other projects: **Blockchain for Trusted Artificial Intelligence and Big Data**, **Vagueness Detection and Interpretation Ranking in Legal Contracts using ChatGPT**, **Data Cooperatives for Privacy and Security**, and **Applications for Secured Metaverse**. The principal motivation behind my research work is to develop efficient and enabling solutions for real-world issues in emerging and novel technologies concerning uncertainty, trust, privacy, and security.


I invite you to read my [publications](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=en&user=bhEKUskAAAAJ&view_op=list_works&sortby=pubdate) and explore my [CV](https://kritagya93.github.io/files/1.CV_Kritagya_Upadhyay.pdf) to uncover the research problems and areas of interest that have been central to my academic and professional journey. This will provide you with valuable insights into my expertise and focus.


## Openings
I am looking for self-motivated students to work and research on projects related to Blockchain and Smart Contracts, Cybersecurity, Natural Language Processing, Artificial Intelligence, Metaverse, and other various emerging hot topics. If you are interested and dedicated, please drop me an email with your CV.
